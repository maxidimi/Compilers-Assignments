Compilers HW2
30/4

- Shadowing,
- On inheritance, in the offset table, we put first the items of the superclass,
- In the table, we put both the variables with same name that both classes have, in case that we need it for an inherited function of superclass, warning: no super. is allowed.
- In overriding between classes, in offset table, the same-named functions are different inputs,
- super.foo == call A::foo
